he following code is used to conduct the experiment for paper: "Higher Order Mining Approach for Analysis of Real-world Datasets".

**Abstract**
In this study, we propose a higher order mining approach that can be used for analysis of real-world datasets. The approach can be used for monitoring and identifying deviating operational behaviour of the studied phenomenon in the absence of prior knowledge about data. The proposed approach consists of several different data analysis techniques such as sequential pattern mining, clustering analysis, consensus clustering and minimum spanning tree (MST). Initially, clustering analysis is performed on the extracted patterns to model the behaviour modes of the studied phenomenon for a given time interval. The built clustering models corresponding to every two consecutive time intervals can further be assessed for mining changes in the monitored behaviour. In case some significant difference is observed, further analysis is performed by integrating the built models into a consensus clustering and applying an MST for identifying deviating behaviours. The validity and potential of the proposed approach has been demonstrated on a real-world dataset originating from a network of district heating (DH) substations. The obtained results show that our approach is capable of detecting deviating and sub-optimal behaviours of the DH substations.
